# Emotion-Detection
This repository includes code for CS4260 Artificial Intelligence final project.


### Prerequisites
To most easily run this code out of the box, the following packages must be installed:
* opencv-python
* fastai==2.7.9
* seaborn==0.12.1
* torch==1.12.1
* torchvision==0.13.1
* streamlit==1.14.0
* matplotlib==3.6.0
* numpy==1.23.1
* tensorflow==2.9.2
* mtcnn==0.1.1


# Project Description
The goal of this project is to utilize the technology of deep learning models to detect different emotions of people in images. The final output of this project will be a website allows users to upload images and get the appropriate emotion of the person in the image. The success criteria will be whether the emotion detected by the application is the same as human judgment.
